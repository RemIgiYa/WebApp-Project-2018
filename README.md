We created this application as a team to demonstrate our skills using API manipulation, serverside scripting using php and we used java script for visual effects.
mySample.php is responsible for creating a keysearch botton to allow user type in words and the api will respond to the request and display results.
loginserv.php is responsible for the craud, it allows user to login using password and username thats already registered and encrypted in the database.
registration.php is responsible for creation, update and deletion of accounts.
